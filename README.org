* Installation including setup of spacemacs and oh-my-zsh
clone this repository and call the =install_script=

** Awesome WM
The =install_script= also symlinks my awesome config into the =~/.config=
folder. So this might fail if you have a existing awesome configuration.

** GNOME Terminal color theme
The install script adds the ~base-16-eighties-dark~ profile to the GNOME Terminal.
Thanks to the [[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-gnome-terminal][Base16 theme.]]

** Cinnamon keybindings

To restore the cinnamon keybindings load the dconf file manually like this:

#+begin_src shell
conf load /org/cinnamon/desktop/keybindings/ < ~/dotfiles/cinnamon/keybindings-backup.dconf
#+end_src

This is not included in the default install script on purpose for now.
